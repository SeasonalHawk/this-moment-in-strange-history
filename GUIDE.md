## What This Project Is

This Moment in Strange History is an AI-powered strange history storytelling application with voice narration. You pick any calendar date. The app uncovers the weird, bizarre, and unexplained events that most history books skip -- mass hysterias, cursed objects, mysterious disappearances, bizarre deaths, and eerie coincidences. Each event becomes a vivid 150-200 word immersive vignette narrated aloud with atmospheric background music. The entire experience generates on demand in under 12 seconds.

Every story is grounded in documented history. Every story is written like literary journalism meets campfire storytelling. Every story comes with an event title, year, and MLA 9th edition citation. Based on [This Moment in History](https://github.com/SeasonalHawk/this-moment-in-history), retuned specifically for the strange and unexplained.

The app is a full-stack Next.js application deployed on Vercel, powered by Anthropic's Claude API for story generation and ElevenLabs' TTS API for voice narration. It was designed, built, and shipped by Kenneth Benavides as a portfolio project demonstrating AI-native application architecture, prompt engineering, and rapid MVP development.

## Why It Exists

History doesn't have to read like a textbook.

Most "this day in history" apps give you a list of bullet points. A sentence about a treaty. A date next to a name. Facts without feeling.

This project started from a different premise: every date has a story worth *feeling*. Not as a list, but as a moment. The smell of gunpowder. The sound of a crowd. The weight of a decision made in a room with bad lighting. The AI system prompt enforces literary journalism rules -- sensory details, real people, real places, present tense, second person. The result reads like the opening paragraph of a magazine feature, not an encyclopedia entry.

The technical goal was equally specific: build a production-quality AI application from zero to deployed in a 3-day sprint, using Claude Code and the Kajiro IQ Pro prompt optimization framework. What was estimated to take 8-11 hours was completed in approximately 8 hours across three evening sessions, shipping 10 MVPs plus v1.0.0 branding with 214 passing tests.

## Tech Stack -- What and Why

Every tool in this stack was chosen for a specific reason. Here's the decision logic behind each one.

### Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router)

**Why:** Server-side API routes protect API keys from browser exposure. The App Router provides file-based routing, React Server Components, and streaming support out of the box. The `/api/pipeline` endpoint uses the Web Streams API (`ReadableStream`) for NDJSON streaming -- something the App Router handles natively.

**Alternative considered:** A separate Express backend. Rejected because it adds deployment complexity, CORS configuration, and a second hosting target. Next.js keeps everything in one deployable unit.

### UI: React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4

**Why React 19:** Hooks-first architecture. The app uses `useState`, `useRef`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect` extensively. `useRef` is critical for timing accuracy (synchronous reads in async code) and audio element lifecycle management. React 19's improved rendering pipeline handles the frequent state updates during streaming without jank.

**Why Tailwind 4:** Utility-first CSS means zero context-switching between component files and stylesheet files. The amber/stone dark theme is expressed entirely in class names -- no CSS files to maintain. Responsive design (audio controls wrap on mobile) is handled with `flex-wrap` and `gap` utilities.

### AI Storytelling: Anthropic Claude API (Haiku)

**Why Claude:** The system prompt for this app is 400+ words of nuanced creative writing instructions with anti-patterns, voice rules, factual integrity constraints, and structural requirements. Claude follows complex multi-constraint instructions with high fidelity. The `tool_use` feature with `tool_choice` forces structured output (story + metadata) in a single API call -- no post-processing or regex parsing needed.

**Why Haiku 4.5 over Sonnet:** MVP 8 switched from `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for speed. Haiku 4.5 delivers similar coding performance to Sonnet 4 at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed. For 150-200 word creative vignettes, the quality difference is negligible -- both models follow the system prompt faithfully. The speed improvement directly impacts user experience. Note: The original target was `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`, but that model was retired by Anthropic on February 19, 2026. The `STORY_MODEL` constant in `src/lib/prompts.ts` serves as a single source of truth -- if Anthropic retires another model, you update one line.

**Why `tool_use` instead of plain text:** Structured output. The `publish_vignette` tool forces Claude to return `story`, `eventTitle`, `eventYear`, and `mlaCitation` as typed JSON fields. No regex parsing, no "please format your response as JSON" prompt hacking. The `tool_choice: { type: 'tool', name: 'publish_vignette' }` parameter guarantees the tool is always called.

### Voice Narration: ElevenLabs TTS API (Flash v2.5)

**Why ElevenLabs:** High-quality neural voice synthesis with multiple model tiers. The Adam voice (`pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB`) provides a deep, authoritative narrator tone that matches the literary journalism style of the stories.

**Why Flash v2.5:** ElevenLabs offers three model tiers:

| Model | Latency | Quality | Used In |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| `eleven_multilingual_v2` | Slowest | Highest | MVP 1-6 |
| `eleven_turbo_v2_5` | Medium | High | MVP 7 |
| `eleven_flash_v2_5` | Fastest | Good | MVP 8 |

Flash v2.5 generates audio for a 150-word story in approximately 5-8 seconds versus 18+ seconds with the multilingual model. For a narrator reading historical vignettes, the quality is more than sufficient.

**Voice settings rationale:**

| Setting | Value | Reasoning |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| `stability` | 0.5 | Balanced -- not robotic, not erratic |
| `similarity_boost` | 0.75 | Strong voice consistency across stories |
| `style` | 0 | Disabled -- reduces latency with minimal audible difference for narrator-style speech |

### Background Music: Static Asset (Voyagers! Theme)

**Why not generated per request:** The Chronostream Runner soundtrack is generated once via ElevenLabs Sound Effects API and saved as a static asset (`public/audio/chronostream-runner.mp3`). This means zero per-request cost, zero latency, and consistent audio across sessions. The music loops at 12% volume -- tuned for the fuller Voyagers!-themed orchestral track.

**Why asymmetric fade:** Fade-in is 2 seconds, fade-out is 3 seconds. This mirrors broadcast audio practice -- listeners notice abrupt silence more than a slow swell. The longer fade-out creates a professional trail-off after the narration copyright outro finishes.

**warmUp() for background music:** Like TTS, the background music Audio element must be created synchronously during a user click to satisfy browser autoplay policy. The `bgMusic.warmUp()` call in `page.tsx` runs in the same click handler as `tts.warmUp()`.

### Calendar: react-day-picker + date-fns

**Why react-day-picker:** Lightweight, accessible, and fully customizable. The dark theme (amber/stone) is applied via CSS class overrides -- no theming library needed. Future dates are disabled with a single `toDate={new Date()}` prop.

**Why date-fns:** Tree-shakeable date formatting. The app only imports `format` -- no moment.js-sized bundle penalty.

### Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library

**Why Vitest over Jest:** Native TypeScript support, faster execution (2.5 seconds for 214 tests), and first-class Vite integration. The `jsdom` environment simulates browser APIs for component testing without a real browser.

**Why React Testing Library:** Tests user-visible behavior, not implementation details. Tests query by text content ("Random History", "Pause"), not by CSS classes or component internals.

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Data Flow

```
User clicks a date (or "Random History")
    |
    v
page.tsx: runPipeline(date, genre?)
    |
    |-- tts.cleanup()            // Destroy previous audio element + blob
    |-- bgMusic.stop()           // Hard stop previous music
    |-- tts.warmUp()             // Create TTS Audio element (autoplay policy)
    |-- bgMusic.warmUp()         // Create bg Audio element (autoplay policy)
    |-- history.startLoading()   // Set loading state
    |-- setPhases([story, audio]) // Pick random themed loading messages
    |
    v
fetch('/api/pipeline', { month, day, genre })
    |
    v
pipeline/route.ts (server):
    |
    |-- validateRequest()       // month 1-12, day 1-31, genre in GENRES
    |-- rateLimit(ip)           // 10 req/IP/60s
    |
    |-- Phase 1: Claude Haiku   // ~3-4 seconds
    |   |-- System prompt + tool_choice
    |   |-- Returns: story, eventTitle, eventYear, mlaCitation
    |   |-- STREAM: {"type":"story", ..., inputTokens, outputTokens}\n
    |
    |-- Phase 2: ElevenLabs Flash  // ~5-8 seconds (starts immediately)
    |   |-- story + outro text --> audio bytes
    |   |-- STREAM: {"type":"audio", "audio":"<base64>", ttsCharacters}\n
    |
    v
page.tsx (client reads NDJSON stream):
    |
    |-- "story" event:
    |   |-- history.setResult()         // Display story immediately
    |   |-- tts.setLoadingState(true)   // Show Voyagers!-themed message
    |   |-- setCostData(tokens)         // Begin cost estimation
    |   |-- LoadingState phase 1 closes, phase 2 opens
    |
    |-- "audio" event:
    |   |-- Decode base64 --> Blob
    |   |-- tts.playBlob(blob)          // Auto-play narration
    |   |-- bgMusic.play()              // Fade in Voyagers! music (2s)
    |   |-- setCostData(chars)          // Complete cost estimation
    |   |-- LoadingState auto-collapses, StoryCard auto-expands
    |
    v
User hears narration with Voyagers! background music.
    |-- When narration ends: bgMusic.fadeOut() (3s fade)
    |-- Controls: Play/Pause, Replay, Download, Mute Music, Random History
    |-- Timing + cost estimate displayed on StoryCard
```

### The NDJSON Streaming Protocol

The pipeline endpoint returns a streaming response with `Content-Type: application/x-ndjson`. Each line is a self-contained JSON object terminated by `\n`:

```
Line 1: {"type":"story","story":"The air smells of...","eventTitle":"...","eventYear":"1945","mlaCitation":"...","date":{"month":3,"day":14},"genre":null}
Line 2: {"type":"audio","audio":"SUQzBAAAAAAAI1RTU0UAAA..."}
```

**Why NDJSON over SSE or WebSockets:**

| Protocol | Complexity | Bi-Directional | Fits This Use Case |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| SSE (`EventSource`) | Medium | No | Overkill -- we only send 2 events |
| WebSockets | High | Yes | Way overkill -- no real-time chat needed |
| NDJSON over `fetch()` | Low | No | Two events, standard fetch, no polyfills |

The client reads the stream with `response.body.getReader()` and splits on newlines. No `EventSource` API needed, no WebSocket handshake, no special libraries.

### The Browser Autoplay Problem (and How It's Solved)

Modern browsers block `audio.play()` unless it's called within the synchronous call stack of a user gesture (click, tap). The problem: our audio is generated by async API calls that happen *after* the click.

**The `warmUp()` pattern:**

```
1. User clicks a date              --> synchronous click handler fires
2. tts.warmUp() runs              --> creates new Audio() element (gesture chain intact)
3. Async API calls happen          --> story + TTS generation (seconds later)
4. tts.playBlob(blob) runs        --> sets .src on the SAME Audio element, calls .play()
5. Browser allows playback         --> because the Audio element was created in step 2
```

The key insight: the browser tracks which `Audio` elements were created during a user gesture. By creating the element synchronously during the click, then reusing it later, we satisfy the autoplay policy without any workarounds.

### Audio Element Lifecycle

The `useTextToSpeech` hook manages a single `Audio` element across its entire lifecycle:

```
warmUp()   --> new Audio(), addEventListener('ended', handler)
playBlob() --> set .src, .play(), track blob for download
pause()    --> .pause(), keep state for resume
resume()   --> .play()
replay()   --> .currentTime = 0, .play()
download() --> URL.createObjectURL(blob), trigger <a> click
cleanup()  --> .pause(), removeEventListener, revokeObjectURL, null refs
```

The `handleEndedRef` pattern uses `useRef` for the event handler to maintain stable identity across renders. Without this, `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` would receive different function references, causing ghost listeners that fire multiple times.

### Background Music Lifecycle

The `useBackgroundMusic` hook manages the Voyagers!-themed Chronostream Runner soundtrack:

```
warmUp()   --> getAudio() (lazy init, sets loop + preload + volume 0)
play()     --> reset to start, fade from 0 to 12% over 2 seconds
fadeOut()   --> fade from current volume to 0 over 3 seconds, then pause + reset
stop()     --> immediate pause + reset (pipeline restart)
pause()    --> pause without reset (sync with narrator pause)
resume()   --> resume playback (sync with narrator resume)
toggleMute() --> mute/unmute without affecting playback state
```

The asymmetric fade (2s in, 3s out) mirrors broadcast audio practice. Listeners notice abrupt silence more than a slow swell, so the fade-out is 50% longer than the fade-in.

### System-Controlled UI Choreography

LoadingState and StoryCard both use the `<Collapsible>` component in `locked` mode. This means:

1. **Cards persist in DOM permanently** -- once mounted, they are never unmounted. Visibility is controlled entirely by the `expanded` prop, not by conditional rendering.
2. **Headers are non-interactive** -- rendered as `<div>` elements instead of `<button>` elements. No user toggle, no cursor pointer, no click handler.
3. **Expand/collapse is derived from props** -- `const expanded = autoExpand` in StoryCard, `const expanded = autoExpand && !autoCollapse` in LoadingState. No internal `useState` or `useEffect` for expand state.

The choreography sequence:
- Pipeline starts → LoadingState expands (shows loading phases)
- Story arrives → LoadingState phase 1 closes, phase 2 opens
- Audio arrives → LoadingState collapses, StoryCard expands
- Both cards remain visible as collapsed headers when not active

## The AI Pipeline

### Story Generation

The system prompt is a 400+ word instruction set that enforces a specific literary style. Here's what it controls:

**Voice rules:**
- Second person ("you") -- places the reader inside the moment
- Present tense -- creates immediacy ("You hear the crack of..." not "The crowd heard...")
- Opens with sensory detail -- never with "On this day in [year]"
- Literary journalism -- real facts, fictional prose style

**Quality gates:**
- Every event, date, person, and location must be historically accurate
- No invented events -- if multiple events occurred, choose the most compelling
- No speculation about thoughts or dialogue unless sourced from historical record
- One scene, one moment -- not a timeline

**Anti-patterns (explicit prohibitions):**
- No "On this day in [year]..." openings
- No Wikipedia-style summaries
- No bullet points or lists
- No meta-commentary about the writing
- No "and that's why this matters" endings

### Genre System

When "Random History" is clicked, one of 20 curated genres is applied as a thematic lens:

> Unexplained Disappearances, Mass Hysteria & Panic, Cursed Objects & Places, Bizarre Deaths, Cryptids & Creature Sightings, Paranormal Investigations, Medical Oddities, Strange Weather & Natural Anomalies, Eerie Coincidences, Forgotten Experiments, Bizarre Laws & Trials, Haunted History, Strange Crimes, Mysterious Signals & Messages, Doomsday Predictions & Cults, Time Slips & Glitches, Odd Traditions & Rituals, Weird Science, Lost Civilizations & Ruins, Unsolved Mysteries

The genre doesn't change the factual requirements -- it shapes the *angle*. A War & Military lens on March 14 might surface a battlefield moment. A Food & Cuisine lens on the same date might surface the day a food safety law was signed. Same date, different story, both historically accurate.

The genre instruction in the user message tells Claude to adopt the tone, pacing, and atmosphere that the genre demands, and to lead with the sensory details that genre thrives on.

### Audio Generation

The narrator reads:
1. The full story text (150-200 words)
2. A brief pause (`\n\n`)
3. The event title
4. The date and year
5. Branding: "This audio is created by This Moment in Strange History. Copyright 2026."

This creates a self-contained audio file. If someone downloads the MP3, the audio itself identifies what event it describes and who created it.

---

## Prompt Engineering Philosophy

This project demonstrates a specific approach to prompt engineering that goes beyond "tell the AI what to do."

### Constraint-Based Prompting

The system prompt doesn't just say "write a good story." It defines:

1. **What to do** (voice rules, structure requirements)
2. **What NOT to do** (anti-patterns, explicit prohibitions)
3. **How to verify quality** (sensory details count, word count range)
4. **Edge cases** (what to do when a date has no famous event)

This constraint-based approach produces more consistent output than open-ended instructions. The anti-patterns section is particularly important -- without it, Claude defaults to encyclopedic openings like "On this day in 1945..." which is exactly what this app avoids.

### Structured Output via Tool Use

Instead of asking Claude to return JSON (which can fail, produce malformed output, or require retry logic), the app uses Claude's `tool_use` feature:

```typescript
tools: [VIGNETTE_TOOL],
tool_choice: { type: 'tool', name: 'publish_vignette' }
```

This guarantees:
- The response always includes `story`, `eventTitle`, `eventYear`, `mlaCitation`
- All fields are properly typed strings
- No JSON parsing errors, no regex extraction, no retry loops
- The model is forced to call the tool -- it cannot respond with plain text

### Genre as a Lens, Not a Filter

The genre system doesn't filter a database of pre-written stories. It instructs Claude to *find* a real event on the given date that fits the genre, then *tell* that story through the genre's lens. This means:

- Every genre + date combination produces a unique story
- The same date can yield 20 different stories (one per genre)
- All stories are historically accurate regardless of genre
- The genre affects tone, pacing, and which details are emphasized -- not factual content

## The Kajiro IQ Pro Methodology

This project was built using Kajiro IQ Pro, a proprietary prompt optimization framework created by Kenneth Benavides. Kajiro IQ Pro operates on the K-A-J-I-R-O framework:

**K -- Kindle:** Define the exact deliverable, format, audience, and success criteria.
**A -- Architect:** Design the workflow with sequenced steps, inputs/outputs, and dependencies.
**J -- Judge:** Establish verification methods, good/bad examples, and review checkpoints.
**I -- Instruct:** Set the expert role, tone, quality standards, and interaction rules.
**R -- Refine:** Iterate based on evaluation results.
**O -- Optimize:** Final polish for production quality.

Every prompt in this project -- from the system prompt to the build instructions to the code review requests -- was evaluated against Kajiro's 21 diagnostic questions and optimized to 14/14 before execution. This methodology is why the system prompt has explicit anti-patterns, why the tool schema has detailed descriptions for every field, and why the build completed in approximately 6 hours instead of the estimated 8-11.

## The MVP Development Approach

The project was built in 10 incremental MVPs, each adding a distinct capability layer. Every MVP was committed, tested, and pushed before the next began.

### Why MVPs Matter

Each MVP produces a *working application*. If development stopped at MVP 1, you'd have a functional story generator. If it stopped at MVP 5, you'd have automatic audio narration. This approach:

- Reduces risk (every commit is deployable)
- Creates clear git history (each feature is one commit)
- Forces clean interfaces (each layer must work with what exists)
- Makes code review tractable (small, focused diffs)

### The 10 Layers

| MVP | Name | What It Added | Key Technical Decision |
|-----|------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Core Story Engine | Calendar + AI stories + citations | Claude tool_use for structured output |
| 2 | Voice Narration | ElevenLabs TTS + play/stop | Audio element lifecycle management |
| 3 | Background Music | Ambient piano loop + mute toggle | Static asset (zero per-request cost) |
| 4 | Random History | 20 genre lenses + random date | Genre as prompt modifier, not data filter |
| 5 | Auto-TTS Pipeline | Automatic audio generation | Unified pipeline replacing manual buttons |
| 6 | Autoplay Fix + Timing | Browser autoplay compliance + timers | `warmUp()` pattern + `useRef` for timing |
| 7 | Efficiency Review | Bug fixes + code cleanup | `handleEndedRef` identity fix, dead prop removal |
| 8 | Streaming Pipeline | NDJSON streaming + faster models | Server-side overlap, Haiku + Flash |
| 9 | Voyagers! Music | Themed soundtrack + cost estimation | Asymmetric fade, bgMusic warmUp, themed loading messages |
| 10 | System-Controlled Accordion | Persistent DOM cards + locked Collapsible | Derived state from props, non-interactive headers |
| v1.0.0 | Branding & Metadata | Midjourney logo, favicons, PWA, OG/Twitter cards | Hybrid branding (PNG raster + SVG inline), `next/image` with priority |

### How Each Layer Built on the Last

MVP 1 established the data model (story + metadata). MVP 2 consumed that data model for narration. MVP 3 synced with MVP 2's playback events. MVP 4 extended MVP 1's API with genre support. MVP 5 unified MVPs 1-4 into an automatic pipeline. MVP 6 fixed a browser-level bug from MVP 5. MVP 7 cleaned up technical debt from MVPs 1-6. MVP 8 replaced the sequential architecture from MVP 5 with a streaming pipeline. MVP 9 replaced the ambient piano with the Voyagers!-themed Chronostream Runner and added cost transparency. MVP 10 introduced the locked Collapsible pattern and made cards persist in the DOM permanently.

Each MVP's interface contract was preserved. `StoryCard` still accepts the same props it has since MVP 6 (plus `autoExpand` from MVP 10). `useTextToSpeech` still exposes `speak()` even though the pipeline now uses `playBlob()`. Backward compatibility was maintained at every layer.

---

## Security Model

### API Key Protection

Both the Anthropic and ElevenLabs API keys are stored in `.env.local` (gitignored) and only accessed in server-side API routes. The browser never sees the keys. The pipeline endpoint runs entirely on the server -- the client only receives story text and audio bytes.

### Rate Limiting

An in-memory rate limiter tracks requests per IP address:

- **Default limit:** 10 requests per IP per 60-second window
- **Shared across endpoints:** `/api/history`, `/api/pipeline`, and `/api/tts` all share the same limiter
- **Configurable:** `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` and `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` environment variables
- **Response:** 429 status with `retryAfter` seconds in the JSON body

### Input Validation

Every API request is validated before any external API call:

- `month` must be an integer 1-12
- `day` must be an integer 1-31
- `genre` (if provided) must exactly match one of the 20 curated genres
- TTS text is capped at 5,000 characters

### HTTP Security Headers

Deployed via `vercel.json`:

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` | Forces HTTPS for 2 years |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Prevents MIME-type sniffing |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Blocks iframe embedding |
| `X-XSS-Protection` | `1; mode=block` | Browser XSS filter |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Limits referrer data leakage |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` | Disables unused browser APIs |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://api.anthropic.com` | Restricts resource loading |

---

## Testing Strategy

### 214 Tests Across 13 Test Files

| File | Tests | What It Covers |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `useBackgroundMusic.test.ts` | 36 | Audio source, warmUp, fade-in/out timing, mute toggle, cleanup, page integration |
| `StoryCard.test.tsx` | 36 | Story rendering, audio controls, genre badge, download, music toggle, locked accordion |
| `Collapsible.test.tsx` | 20 | Interactive toggle, locked mode, aria attributes, chevron rotation, opacity transitions |
| `validation.test.ts` | 18 | Input validation for month, day, genre. Month name mapping. User message construction with and without genre. |
| `ttsRoute.test.ts` | 16 | Voice ID (Adam), model (Flash v2.5), API URL, text validation, voice settings |
| `issueTwoRegression.test.ts` | 16 | Loading UX guards, pipeline config, architecture regression tests |
| `pipelineConfig.test.ts` | 16 | Pipeline models (Haiku + Flash), retired model guard, shared prompt content |
| `rateLimit.test.ts` | 15 | Allow/block logic, per-IP tracking, window reset, concurrent request handling |
| `LoadingState.test.tsx` | 14 | Phases, live timers, auto-expand/collapse, locked mode, themed messages |
| `costs.test.ts` | 12 | Cost calculation accuracy, formatting, edge cases, token/character pricing |
| `issueOneRegression.test.ts` | 10 | Architecture guards -- warmUp, playBlob, pipeline helpers, handleEndedRef |
| `loadingMessages.test.ts` | 10 | Message array integrity, pickRandom distribution, Voyagers! theme messages |
| `genres.test.ts` | 5 | Genre list integrity, random selection |

### Testing Philosophy

Tests verify user-visible behavior, not implementation details:

```typescript
// Good: tests what the user sees
expect(screen.getByText('Random History')).toBeInTheDocument();

// Good: tests interaction behavior
fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Pause'));
expect(onTogglePlayPause).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();

// Avoided: testing internal state or CSS classes
// expect(component.state.isPlaying).toBe(true);  // Never do this
```

Configuration tests verify that hardcoded constants match expected values -- catching accidental changes to model IDs, voice IDs, or prompt content.

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-key
```

### Run

```bash
pnpm dev           # Start development server on http://localhost:3000
pnpm test          # Run all 214 tests
pnpm build         # Production build

# Or use convenience scripts:
./start.sh         # Launches pnpm dev in background
./stop.sh          # Kills process on port 3000
```

### Optional Configuration

```env
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=10           # Max requests per IP per window (default: 10)
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000  # Rate limit window in milliseconds (default: 60000)
```

## How to Extend It

### Add a New Genre

1. Open `src/lib/genres.ts`
2. Add your genre string to the `GENRES` array
3. The genre is automatically available in Random History -- no other changes needed
4. Update the genre count in tests (`genres.test.ts`)

### Change the AI Model

Edit `src/lib/prompts.ts` for the system prompt, or the model string in:
- `src/app/api/pipeline/route.ts` (streaming pipeline -- primary)
- `src/app/api/history/route.ts` (standalone fallback)

### Change the Narrator Voice

1. Find the voice ID on [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library)
2. Update `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` in:
   - `src/app/api/pipeline/route.ts`
   - `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`
3. Adjust `voice_settings` (stability, similarity_boost) to match the new voice's characteristics

### Add a New Loading Phase

1. Add a new NDJSON event type in `pipeline/route.ts` (e.g., `{"type":"enrichment", ...}`)
2. Handle the event in `page.tsx`'s NDJSON reader loop
3. Add a new `LoadingState` message for that phase

### Replace Background Music

1. Replace `public/audio/chronostream-runner.mp3` with your audio file
2. Ensure it loops cleanly (the `<audio>` element has `loop: true`)
3. Adjust `TARGET_VOLUME` in `src/hooks/useBackgroundMusic.ts` (currently 0.12 for the fuller orchestral track -- simpler tracks may work better at higher volumes)
4. Test fade-in/out durations -- `FADE_IN_MS` and `FADE_OUT_MS` may need tuning for different track characters

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Autoplay Policy Is Not Optional

Browsers will silently reject `audio.play()` if the call isn't in a user gesture's synchronous stack. The fix (creating the `Audio` element during the click, reusing it later) is non-obvious but reliable. This is the kind of bug that only appears in production browsers, never in tests.

### 2. Event Listener Identity Matters

Using a plain function as an event handler in a React component creates a new function reference on every render. `removeEventListener` silently fails if the reference doesn't match the one passed to `addEventListener`. The fix: `useRef` for stable handler identity.

### 3. Faster Models Are Usually Good Enough

Switching from Sonnet to Haiku for 150-word stories produced no noticeable quality drop. The system prompt's constraint-based design means even smaller models follow the rules. Don't pay for model capability you don't need.

### 4. Server-Side Overlap Beats Client-Side Parallelism

Running TTS on the server immediately after story generation (one endpoint, zero round-trip) is faster than having the client fetch the story, parse it, then fire a separate TTS request. The saved round-trip is only 100-200ms, but the architectural simplicity is worth more.

### 5. Structured Output Eliminates an Entire Class of Bugs

Claude's `tool_use` with `tool_choice` guarantees typed JSON output. No regex parsing, no "the model returned markdown instead of JSON" bugs, no retry logic for malformed responses. If you're building with Claude and need structured data, always use tools.

### 6. MVPs Compound

Each MVP took less time than the one before because the interfaces were already defined. MVP 8 (streaming pipeline) reused the same `StoryCard` component from MVP 1, the same `useTextToSpeech` hook from MVP 2, and the same validation logic from MVP 1. The hooks just gained new methods (`playBlob`, `setLoadingState`) without breaking existing ones.

### 7. Persistent DOM Beats Conditional Rendering for Animated Components

MVP 10 revealed that conditionally rendering components (`{loading && <LoadingState />}`) causes them to unmount and lose all animation state. When the component remounts, it flashes -- no smooth transition, no collapsed header, just a jarring pop-in. Keeping components in the DOM permanently and controlling visibility via props (locked Collapsible, `autoExpand`) produces polished transitions without flash-of-unmount bugs. The cost is trivial -- a few hidden DOM nodes.

### 8. Asymmetric Fade Durations Mirror Broadcast Practice

Fade-in and fade-out don't need to be symmetrical. The Voyagers! music uses 2 seconds fade-in but 3 seconds fade-out. Listeners notice abrupt silence more than a slow swell, so the fade-out is 50% longer. This small asymmetry creates a noticeably more professional audio experience -- the music trails off gracefully after the narration copyright outro instead of cutting abruptly.
