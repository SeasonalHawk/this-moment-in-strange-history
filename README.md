# This Moment in History

An AI-powered creative nonfiction storytelling app with voice narration. Pick any calendar date and receive a vivid 150-200 word historical vignette — not a Wikipedia summary, but an immersive second-person narrative that drops you into the moment. Audio narration auto-generates with ambient background music for an immersive documentary-style experience.

## How It Works

1. **Pick a date** from the calendar
2. **Read** the AI-generated creative nonfiction vignette
3. **Listen** — narration auto-generates with Adam's voice and soft piano accompaniment
4. **Control** — Play/Pause, Replay, Download MP3, Mute Music
5. **Discover** — click "Random History" for a genre-themed story from a random date
6. **Download** the audio as an MP3 (includes branding outro)

## MVP Releases

### MVP 1 — Core Story Engine (March 13, 2026)

The foundation: pick a date, get a story.

- Calendar date picker with amber/stone dark theme
- AI-generated creative nonfiction vignettes (200-300 words)
- Second-person, present-tense immersive storytelling
- "Spin Your Luck" button for alternate stories on the same date
- Event title, year, and MLA 9th edition citation with every story
- Server-side API key protection
- In-memory rate limiting (10 req/IP/60s)

- 54 tests passing

### MVP 3 — Background Music (March 14, 2026)

Added subtle ambient music that plays during narration.

- Dreamscape piano loop generated via ElevenLabs Sound Effects API
- Saved as static asset (`public/audio/ambient-bg.mp3`) — zero per-request cost
- Plays at 10% volume — subtle, non-intrusive
- Music starts when narrator begins, stops when narrator stops
- Mute toggle button (music note icon with strikethrough when muted)
- Mute only affects volume — does not start or stop playback independently
- 61 tests passing

### MVP 4 — Random History (March 14, 2026)

Added genre-based discovery — explore history through thematic lenses.

- "Random History" button replaces "Spin Your Luck" — picks a random date and genre
- 20 curated content genres: True Crime, Espionage & Spies, War & Military, Science & Discovery, Love & Romance, Betrayal & Revenge, Survival & Exploration, Rise & Fall of Empires, Innovation & Invention, Art & Culture, Sports & Competition, Natural Disasters, Revolution & Rebellion, Medicine & Plague, Money & Economics, Religion & Faith, Women Who Changed History, Unsolved Mysteries, Food & Cuisine, Conspiracy & Mystery
- Genre used as thematic lens for AI story generation via Kajiro IQ Pro prompting
- Genre badge displayed on story card
- Genre validation on server-side
- 70 tests passing

### MVP 5 — Auto-TTS Pipeline (March 14, 2026)

Seamless audio experience — narration auto-generates as part of the story pipeline.

- Auto-generate TTS audio immediately after story loads (no manual button click)
- Multi-phase loading states: "Uncovering history..." then "Finding our history professor..."
- Play/Pause toggle replaces the old "Read to Me" / "Stop Reading" buttons
- Replay button to restart narration from the beginning
- Background music fade-in (0 to 15% volume over 2 seconds)
- Background music pauses/resumes in sync with narrator play/pause
- Full audio state reset on date change and Random History click
- Reduced Claude API max_tokens from 2048 to 1024 for faster response times
- fetchStory() returns data directly for zero-delay TTS trigger
- Removed manual "Read to Me" button — audio is now fully automatic
- 74 tests passing

### MVP 6 — Autoplay Fix + Pipeline Timing (March 14, 2026)

Fixed browser autoplay policy and added real-time performance feedback.

- `warmUp()` pattern — creates Audio element synchronously during user click to satisfy browser autoplay policy, then reuses it for TTS playback after async API calls complete
- Real-time elapsed timer during both loading phases (updates every 100ms)
- Pipeline timing breakdown on story card: "Story Xs · Audio Ys · Total Zs"
- `phaseStartRef` uses `useRef` (not state) for synchronous timing accuracy in async code
- Timing resets on every new date selection or Random History click
- 78 tests passing

### MVP 7 — Efficiency Review (March 14, 2026)

Code quality pass — removed dead code, fixed bugs, optimized performance.

- Fixed `handleEnded` identity bug — converted to `useRef` for stable `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` identity
- Removed dead `audioPaused` prop from StoryCard (accepted but never used in rendering)
- Added defensive `URL.revokeObjectURL` guard in `speak()` to prevent blob memory leaks
- Removed redundant `cleanup()` call inside `warmUp()` (callers already call cleanup)
- Extracted `runPipeline()` to unify `handleDateSelect` and `handleRandomHistory` flows
- Moved `formatMs` to module scope (was recreated every render)
- Switched ElevenLabs model from `eleven_multilingual_v2` to `eleven_turbo_v2_5`
- Set ElevenLabs `style: 0` to reduce TTS latency
- Reduced Claude `max_tokens` from 1024 to 512
- 78 tests passing (8 files changed, 62 insertions, 90 deletions)

### MVP 8 — Streaming Pipeline + Speed Optimization (March 14, 2026)

3x faster pipeline — unified streaming endpoint with faster AI models.

- **Unified `/api/pipeline` endpoint** — single NDJSON streaming request handles both story generation and TTS audio, eliminating client round-trip between phases
- **Server-side overlap** — TTS generation fires immediately after story completes on the server, without waiting for story data to reach the client first
- **Claude Haiku model** (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`) — ~3-5x faster story generation vs Sonnet
- **ElevenLabs Flash model** (`eleven_flash_v2_5`) — fastest available TTS model, lowest latency
- **Shorter vignettes** (150-200 words vs 200-300) — less text = faster TTS generation
- **NDJSON streaming** — client reads story and audio as separate lines; story displays immediately while TTS still generates
- **Shared prompt module** (`src/lib/prompts.ts`) — system prompt and tool definition extracted to shared module, eliminating duplication between `/api/history` and `/api/pipeline`
- **`playBlob()` method** on `useTextToSpeech` — plays pre-fetched audio blobs directly, bypassing the standalone `/api/tts` fetch
- **`setLoadingState()` method** on `useTextToSpeech` — allows pipeline orchestrator to control TTS loading indicator during server-side audio generation
- **Pipeline helpers** on `useHistoryStory` — `startLoading()`, `setResult()`, `setErrorState()` enable streaming pipeline to update story state without calling `fetchStory()`
- Standalone `/api/history` and `/api/tts` endpoints kept as fallbacks
- Previous pipeline: Story ~13s (Sonnet) + Audio ~18.5s (Turbo) = ~31.4s sequential
- Target pipeline: Story ~3-4s (Haiku) + Audio ~5-8s (Flash) = ~8-12s with server overlap
- 92 tests passing

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Anthropic API key from console.anthropic.com |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Yes | ElevenLabs API key (needs `text_to_speech` permission) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | No | Max requests per IP per window (default: 10) |

## The Story Behind the Build

This project started as a portfolio build challenge: go from zero to deployed in a 3-day sprint, following a structured build guide. What was estimated to take 8-11 hours across 3 days was completed in two evening sessions (~6 hours total) using Claude Code and the Kajiro IQ Pro prompt optimization framework.

The core idea: history doesn't have to read like a textbook. Every date has a story worth telling — not as a list of facts, but as a moment you can feel. The AI system prompt enforces literary journalism rules: sensory details, real people, real places, present tense, second person. No "On this day in..." openings. No Wikipedia summaries. Just immersive storytelling grounded in fact.

MVP 2 and MVP 3 elevated the experience from reading to listening — adding voice narration and ambient music turned a text app into something closer to an audio documentary experience, all generated on demand. MVP 4 added genre-based discovery, MVP 5 made the entire audio pipeline automatic, MVP 6 fixed browser autoplay compliance and added real-time pipeline performance metrics, MVP 7 cleaned up code quality and fixed bugs, and MVP 8 introduced a unified streaming pipeline with faster AI models to cut total generation time from ~31s to ~8-12s.

## Build Timeline

| Metric | Build Guide Estimate | Actual |
