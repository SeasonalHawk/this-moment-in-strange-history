# This Moment in History

An AI-powered creative nonfiction storytelling app with voice narration. Pick any calendar date and receive a vivid 200-300 word historical vignette — not a Wikipedia summary, but an immersive second-person narrative that drops you into the moment. Audio narration auto-generates with ambient background music for an immersive documentary-style experience.

## How It Works

1. **Pick a date** from the calendar
2. **Read** the AI-generated creative nonfiction vignette
3. **Listen** — narration auto-generates with Adam's voice and soft piano accompaniment
4. **Control** — Play/Pause, Replay, Download MP3, Mute Music
5. **Discover** — click "Random History" for a genre-themed story from a random date
6. **Download** the audio as an MP3 (includes branding outro)

## MVP Releases

### MVP 1 — Core Story Engine (March 13, 2026)

The foundation: pick a date, get a story.

- Calendar date picker with amber/stone dark theme
- AI-generated creative nonfiction vignettes (200-300 words)
- Second-person, present-tense immersive storytelling
- "Spin Your Luck" button for alternate stories on the same date
- Event title, year, and MLA 9th edition citation with every story
- Server-side API key protection
- In-memory rate limiting (10 req/IP/60s)
- Input validation (month 1-12, day 1-31, spin 0-50)
- Security headers via vercel.json
- 33 unit tests passing

### MVP 2 — Voice Narration (March 14, 2026)

Added "Read to Me" — hear the story narrated aloud.

- ElevenLabs TTS integration with Adam voice (deep, authoritative narrator)
- "Read to Me" button with loading/playing/stopped states
- Auto-play after audio loads
- "Stop Reading" button to halt narration
- Audio auto-stops when picking a new date or spinning
- Download button — save narration as MP3
- Narration ending reads: event title, date, year, then branding outro
- Branding: "This audio is created by This Moment in History. Copyright 2026."
- Download filename includes event title (e.g., `this-moment-in-history-the-fall-of-the-berlin-wall.mp3`)
- 54 tests passing

### MVP 3 — Background Music (March 14, 2026)

Added subtle ambient music that plays during narration.

- Dreamscape piano loop generated via ElevenLabs Sound Effects API
- Saved as static asset (`public/audio/ambient-bg.mp3`) — zero per-request cost
- Plays at 10% volume — subtle, non-intrusive
- Music starts when narrator begins, stops when narrator stops
- Mute toggle button (music note icon with strikethrough when muted)
- Mute only affects volume — does not start or stop playback independently
- 61 tests passing

### MVP 4 — Random History (March 14, 2026)

Added genre-based discovery — explore history through thematic lenses.

- "Random History" button replaces "Spin Your Luck" — picks a random date and genre
- 20 curated content genres: True Crime, Espionage & Spies, War & Military, Science & Discovery, Love & Romance, Betrayal & Revenge, Survival & Exploration, Rise & Fall of Empires, Innovation & Invention, Art & Culture, Sports & Competition, Natural Disasters, Revolution & Rebellion, Medicine & Plague, Money & Economics, Religion & Faith, Women Who Changed History, Unsolved Mysteries, Food & Cuisine, Conspiracy & Mystery
- Genre used as thematic lens for AI story generation via Kajiro IQ Pro prompting
- Genre badge displayed on story card
- Genre validation on server-side
- 70 tests passing

### MVP 5 — Auto-TTS Pipeline (March 14, 2026)

Seamless audio experience — narration auto-generates as part of the story pipeline.

- Auto-generate TTS audio immediately after story loads (no manual button click)
- Multi-phase loading states: "Uncovering history..." then "Finding our history professor..."
- Play/Pause toggle replaces the old "Read to Me" / "Stop Reading" buttons
- Replay button to restart narration from the beginning
- Background music fade-in (0 to 15% volume over 2 seconds)
- Background music pauses/resumes in sync with narrator play/pause
- Full audio state reset on date change and Random History click
- Reduced Claude API max_tokens from 2048 to 1024 for faster response times
- fetchStory() returns data directly for zero-delay TTS trigger
- Removed manual "Read to Me" button — audio is now fully automatic
- 74 tests passing

### MVP 6 — Autoplay Fix + Pipeline Timing (March 14, 2026)

Fixed browser autoplay policy and added real-time performance feedback.

- `warmUp()` pattern — creates Audio element synchronously during user click to satisfy browser autoplay policy, then reuses it for TTS playback after async API calls complete
- Real-time elapsed timer during both loading phases (updates every 100ms)
- Pipeline timing breakdown on story card: "Story Xs · Audio Ys · Total Zs"
- `phaseStartRef` uses `useRef` (not state) for synchronous timing accuracy in async code
- Timing resets on every new date selection or Random History click
- 78 tests passing

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Anthropic API key from console.anthropic.com |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Yes | ElevenLabs API key (needs `text_to_speech` permission) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | No | Max requests per IP per window (default: 10) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | No | Rate limit window in ms (default: 60000) |

## Security

- Both API keys are server-side only — never exposed to the browser
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (10 req/IP/min, shared across endpoints)
- Security headers configured in vercel.json (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- `.env.local` is gitignored — keys never enter version control
- TTS text input capped at 5,000 characters

## Testing

```bash
npm test          # Run all 78 tests
npm run test:watch # Watch mode
```

| Test File | Tests | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| validation.test.ts | 18 | Input validation, monthName, buildUserMessage, genre validation |
| rateLimit.test.ts | 5 | Allow/block, per-IP tracking, window reset |
| StoryCard.test.tsx | 29 | Rendering, audio controls, genre badge, download, music toggle, timing label |
| LoadingState.test.tsx | 5 | Loading text, skeleton lines, custom messages, elapsed timer |
| genres.test.ts | 5 | Genre list integrity, random selection |
| ttsRoute.test.ts | 16 | TTS validation, voice config, voice settings |

## The Story Behind the Build

This project started as a portfolio build challenge: go from zero to deployed in a 3-day sprint, following a structured build guide. What was estimated to take 8-11 hours across 3 days was completed in two evening sessions (~5 hours total) using Claude Code and the Kajiro IQ Pro prompt optimization framework.

The core idea: history doesn't have to read like a textbook. Every date has a story worth telling — not as a list of facts, but as a moment you can feel. The AI system prompt enforces literary journalism rules: sensory details, real people, real places, present tense, second person. No "On this day in..." openings. No Wikipedia summaries. Just immersive storytelling grounded in fact.

MVP 2 and MVP 3 elevated the experience from reading to listening — adding voice narration and ambient music turned a text app into something closer to an audio documentary experience, all generated on demand. MVP 4 added genre-based discovery, MVP 5 made the entire audio pipeline automatic, and MVP 6 fixed browser autoplay compliance and added real-time pipeline performance metrics so users see exactly how long each phase takes.

## Build Timeline

| Metric | Build Guide Estimate | Actual |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Total timeline | 3 days (8-11 hrs) | 2 evening sessions |
| MVP 1 complete | Day 1-2 | March 13, 2026 (3.5 hrs) |
| MVP 2 + MVP 3 complete | — | March 14, 2026 (1.5 hrs) |
| MVP 4 + MVP 5 + MVP 6 complete | — | March 14, 2026 (same session) |
| Total time | 8-11 hrs | ~5 hrs |
| Time saved | — | ~50% |
| Built with | — | Claude Code + Kajiro IQ Pro |
